### Final Project

# Final project of a tourism app designed for mobile.

Final project I made for ISDI coders web development bootcamp. It features a complete CRUD on the ruins, and can
add and delete comments, as well as add ruins to visited and favorites. Made with Vue 3 and Vuex 4, tested with
Jest and vue testing utils, as well as Cypress for E2E testing.

Work in progress!

# Roadmap

- Add a map for every ruin, with user and ruin location, and ability to trace the fastest route to the location.
- Remake the web version for better readability.
- Add more error controls and action feedback.
- Add more images and a image carousel to any one ruin.
- Allow the user to modify their user data, including a profile picture.
- Update the comment field for better readibility.
