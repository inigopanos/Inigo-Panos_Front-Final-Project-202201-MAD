### Final Project

# Final project of a tourism app designed for mobile.

Final project I made for ISDI coders web development bootcamp. It features a complete CRUD on the ruins, and can
add and delete comments, as well as add ruins to visited and favorites. Made with Vue 3 and Vuex 4, tested with
Jest and vue testing utils, as well as Cypress for E2E testing.

Work in progress!
